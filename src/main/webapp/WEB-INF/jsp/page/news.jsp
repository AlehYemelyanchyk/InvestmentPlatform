                <p> Investing.com - Heightened tensions between the U.S. and China will mean that risk sentiment remains
                    fragile
                    this week, while the highlight of the economic calendar will be Friday's May non-farm payrolls
                    report.
                    Ahead
                    of
                    that, investors will have the chance to parse other economic data, including initial jobless claims
                    and
                    factory
                    orders. The European Central Bank is widely expected to top-up its emergency asset purchasing
                    program
                    and
                    the UK
                    and European Union are to hold another round of virtual Brexit talks. Here’s what you need to know
                    to
                    start
                    your
                    week. </p>
                <p>U.S. unemployment seen soaring to near 20%
                    Friday's U.S. jobs report is expected to show that the unemployment rate rose to 19.7% last month
                    with
                    employers
                    forecast to have cut 8.25 million jobs, compared with the record 20.5 million jobs lost in
                    April.</p>
                <p>While some encouraging signs in the employment picture have emerged in recent weeks as some workers
                    rejoin
                    jobs
                    with businesses starting to reopen in the second half of the month, these changes are unlikely to be
                    reflected
                    in the May data.</p>
                <p>Any positive surprise, however, is likely to be cheered by stock market bulls eager to grasp at signs
                    of
                    a
                    rebound from the coronavirus induced economic slump.</p>
                <p>Jobless claims, ISM data
                    While Federal Reserve officials are now in the traditional blackout period ahead of their next
                    policy
                    meeting in
                    June the calendar this week features ISM manufacturing data Monday, Thursday’s jobless claims report
                    and
                    reports
                    on factory orders and private sector hiring.</p>
                <p>In the euro zone investors will be looking at figures on German factory orders for April while the UK
                    calendar
                    has the final manufacturing PMI on Monday and then the final services PMI on Wednesday.</p>
                <p>U.S.-China standoff
                    The standoff between the worlds two largest economies over Beijing’s new security legislation for
                    Hong
                    Kong,
                    which investors fear could erode the city's freedoms, looks set to continue this week.</p>
                <p>U.S. President Donald Trump has vowed to end Hong Kong's special status if Beijing imposes new
                    national
                    security
                    laws on the on the Asian financial center, but China's state media has pushed back, saying this
                    would
                    hurt
                    the
                    United States more than China.</p>
                <p>Whether Trump goes so far as to scrap his Phase 1 trade deal with China or merely takes some symbolic
                    steps
                    around sanctions and visas for Hong Kong citizens could determine how long the latest global stock
                    market
                    rally
                    will last.</p>
                <p>ECB to boost stimulus program
                    While on the face of it the announcement of the 750 billion euro EU plan to prop up economies hit by
                    the
                    coronavirus pandemic has eased some pressure on the ECB, officials are still expected to unveil
                    fresh
                    stimulus
                    on Thursday.</p>
                <p>The EU recovery fund will take time to set up and will likely face hurdles on the way and the ECB is
                    burning
                    through its emergency asset purchases, which will likely run dry by October - unless expanded.</p>
                <p>The ECB is widely expected to announce a 500 billion-euro ($555 billion) increase to its Pandemic
                    Emergence
                    Purchase Program and extend is duration until mid-2021.</p>
                <p>The central bank will also publish updated economic projections which could confirm President
                    Christine
                    Lagarde’s assessment that the bloc’s economy is in the midst of a much-deeper downturn than
                    initially
                    believed.</p>
